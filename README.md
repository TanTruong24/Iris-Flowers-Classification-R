# Iris Flowers Classification R

The project is a practical exercise in data mining. In the project, we use R language and machine learning algorithms to classify, evaluate and compare results on the Iris Flower dataset.

- packages used: randomForest, e1071, ggplot2, klaR, xgboost, magrittr, dplyr
- ML Algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a linear kernel., Random Forest (RF), XGboost, NavieBayes

The report includes theory on how to use R, R packages, install RStudio and evaluate and compare results from testing on the Iris Flower dataset.
